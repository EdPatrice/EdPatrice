# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ed

I'm a curious mind obsessed with **tech, AI, and turning caffeine into code** ☕💡.  
I'm a **Computer Science student** and an aspiring **Data Scientist** with a passion for building smart, useful things — from web extensions that *actually* do something cool, to AI-powered tools that (hopefully) won’t become sentient... yet 🤖.

## 🧠 What I Do

I tinker with **Python** and **SQL** like they’re LEGO bricks.  
I enjoy breaking down complex problems, exploring how systems think, and asking:

> *"What if we automated this... with style?"* 😏

## 🚀 Projects I Love

- 🤖⚙️ AI-enhanced apps & smart automations  
- 🌐✨ Browser extensions that make the web a little more helpful  
- 🧼💥 Clean, clever code that does more with less

## 📚 Always learning. Always questioning. Always debugging at 2am.

Let’s build something awesome together —  
and maybe break the internet (just a little) 😅💥
